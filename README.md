# Maileon .NET API Client

This is the implementation of the Maileon API for .NET applications.

## Documentation
See the official [Maileon API documentation](http://dev.maileon.com/api/rest-api-1-0/?lang=en) for more information about the Maileon API.
This library attempts to implement all the features of the Maileon API as they become available. 

## Usage
The library is split into various services; these services provide a way to manipulate different parts of the API.
In most cases the path of the specific request determines the actual service that will provide that call in this library.
For example all the calls relating to transactions (/transaction/*) can be found in the MaileonTransactionsService class.

To use the Maileon API you have to provide a valid MaileonConfiguration object to the service classes. 
The configuration contains information required to properly reach and authenticate with the API server.

Currently available base URIs:
* https://adc.maileon.com/svc/ for AddressCheck
* https://api.maileon.com/1.0/ for everything else

For information about the API keys and API key privileges contact your Maileon provider.
